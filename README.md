# Ising-Model

A simulation of the Ising Model of ferromagnetism using Python. The Ising model is implemented with a Monte Carlo method, the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm.

The model is a square lattice of sites that can be in one of two states, -1 or +1. In this simulation, each state represent  the atomic spins. When these atomic spins align together, their generated magnetic dipole moments point in the same direction and they yield a net macroscopic magnetic moment, causing ferromagnetism.
